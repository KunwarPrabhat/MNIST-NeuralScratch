## MNIST-NeuralScratch
### "A neural network built from scratch , without any machine learning libraries to classify MNIST digits using only 'Python' and 'Numpy'.
### This was just a fun project that I made for my in depth understanding of neural networks with deeplearning algorithms and Machine Learning.
#### Since GitHub doesn't allow sharing of large files you can download the DataSet from this link :- 
        - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EPwKl32m4vDzuaRVzPpaIcR4d74J3pzs?usp=sharing
        - Make sure that the train.csv and test.csv files are placed inside the 'src' folder before runnig the model.
## **Working**
- Everything including activation functions, backward propagation and Training loops are implemented from scratch.
- The network has:
  - Input Layer: 784 neurons (for flattened 28x28 pixel images).
  - Hidden Layers: Two fully connected layers with 128 and 64 neurons.
  - Output Layer: 10 neurons (for digit classification 0â€“9).
